## CS 31 Spring 2019 Debugging Workshop
The two source files that we will be debugging: `rectangle.cpp` and `jewels.cpp`
### Setup
Create a new project in your IDE (Xcode, VS). Click on the desired file. Copy the code into your project. (You can also click `Raw` and copy it from there.)

Make sure that you create a separate project for each file.

### Slides
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> You will need to be logged into your g.ucla.edu account in order to view the slides.
